Hi there, I am **Shengkai Li**, aka **Naclist**, a student specializing in **bioinformatics** and **pathogen genetics**, equipped with edge-cutting analytical technology. With expertise in **population genetics**, **mathematical programming**, **bioinformatic sequence database** and more, I approach research from multiple perspectives. My passion lies in developing a universal framework to better understand how bacteria/virus adapt to ever-changing challenges of the Anthropocene.

I am currently looking for a PhD opportunity – I’d like to connect with anyone interested!
