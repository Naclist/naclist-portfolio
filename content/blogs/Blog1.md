These days, I’ve been doing something that feels both exciting and exhausting—trying to get into a PhD program in Europe. Honestly, when I first started, I had no idea how complicated this would be. I thought, just send some emails and wait for replies, right? Well… no.

I wrote to a bunch of professors whose work I really admire. Some never replied, some said funding is tight. Every email felt like throwing a bottle into the ocean. And every time I saw “no funding available,” I had that sinking feeling. For a while, I wondered if I should just give up. Since my GPA and school suck soooo bad, a lot of people online kept saying I can hardly get a PhD position. 

But I realized I can’t. I really want this. Not just a title, but the chance to work on bacteria, to understand how they adapt and spread, and evolution thereafter. So, I told myself: If it’s hard, then work harder. **This might be the bravest and most proactive moment of my entire life**.

Now, besides drafting research ideas and proposals, I’m also fighting another battle—English. I’ve been learning IELTS stuff again. Sometimes it’s fun, sometimes it’s just painful.

I don’t know how long this will take, or how many more emails I’ll send. But I know one thing: I’m not stopping.
